# 🎬 Movie Rankings Analysis – Power BI Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores **what factors influence a movie’s ranking**, analyzing trends over time and across different genres. The visualizations provide insights into how **genre, time period, and production trends** impact rankings, helping to identify patterns in movie success.

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights  

1. **Average Movie Rank by Year** – Examines how movie rankings have changed over time, showing trends in audience and critic perceptions.
2. **Average Movie Rank by Genre** – Highlights which movie genres receive the highest and lowest rankings.
3. **Distribution of Movies Across Genres** – Shows the most frequently produced movie genres, comparing popularity with ranking performance.
   
### 📈 Key Findings  
- **Documentary and Film-Noir movies** tend to receive higher rankings, while **Sci-Fi and Horror films** rank lower.  
- Movie rankings have **slightly declined over time**, possibly due to evolving rating standards or shifts in audience expectations.  
- **Drama and Short films are the most produced genres**, but they do not necessarily have the highest rankings.  
- Some genres have shown **ranking consistency**, while others have fluctuated significantly over different time periods.  

## 🛠️ How to Use  
1. Open the **Power BI file (`movies.pbix`)** to interact with the visualizations.  
2. Adjust filters (e.g., years, genres) to explore different insights.  
3. Modify the dataset if additional analysis is required.  

## 🔍 Future Enhancements  
- **Director Analysis:** Identify which directors consistently produce highly ranked movies.  
- **Audience vs. Critic Ratings:** Compare general audience scores with critic-based rankings.  
- **Decade-Based Trends:** Aggregate data by decade to observe broader historical trends.
